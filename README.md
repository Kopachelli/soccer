Trying my hand at soccer analytics with help from @statsbomb and @FCrSTATS 

Don't want to take too much credit for what will be in here, but want to keep track of it. Pitches from FCrSTATS, data from statsbomb. I hope to update this with different types of plots and some ideas you can learn from them. Maybe I'll be successful.
